  OmniStack #10: DevRadar

![](mockup.gif)

## Description
DevRadar is a project I built during Rocketseat's Semana OmniStack. It is a complete application (mobile, front and back-end) for a basic developer finder based on your location. You can find developers by searching for a specific technology.
The front-end takes care of adding users to the database and the mobile shows those users based on your location and the technology you typed in.

## Setup back-end
Change directory to the backend folder `cd backend` and run `yarn install`.
At this point you shoud have the back-end all set up and good to go.

- Start server
```
yarn dev
```

## Setup front-end
Change directory to the front-end folder `cd web` and run `yarn install`.

- Start server
```
yarn start
```

## Setup mobile
Change directory to the mobile folder `cd mobile` and run `yarn install`.

- Build app and run with Expo
```
yarn start
```

Thanks for checking this project out! Cheers!
